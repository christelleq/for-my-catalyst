## The Journey Journal

### 26/09/22
#### Actions / Achievements
1. Research whether to use JavaScript or TypeScript: TS reduces bugs (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydkQlJhodio&t=395s).
2. Design research: examples of data analyst portfolio websites (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7ExqKejFg), atomic design (https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).
3. Research how to structure React files: you can group files by features or file types, recommendation: <=4 folder nesting, https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html.
4. Asked client to think about the design and content of their portfolio website.
5. Research alternatives to React: skimmed https://www.spec-india.com/blog/react-alternatives.
6. 2/3 of issue #1.

#### Thoughts:
1. TypeScript reduces bugs, but is it necessary for a simple website? It could be helpful, especially to make sure my props are of the right type. Also, it's something new to learn. I will use TypeScript.
2. I'll continue to use React because it works and there is some time-sensitivity to this project, so I don't want to use a completely new set of tools. How much time exactly? Definitely before November.
3. I will use Vite because it's easier to work with during development, enabling changes to be seen instantly. 
4. I will start from scratch without a boilerplate to deepen my understanding of the contents of the package.json file.
5. I will use Firebase for deployment because it's easy, free, and works. 
6. To plan the file structure, I need to know the site's contents.
7. Build Petr a blog to encourage his dream of writing.
