## The Journey Journal

### 26/09/22
#### Actions / Achievements:
1. Research whether to use JavaScript or TypeScript: TS reduces bugs (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydkQlJhodio&t=395s).
2. Design research: examples of data analyst portfolio websites (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7ExqKejFg), atomic design (https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).
3. Research how to structure React files: you can group files by features or file types, recommendation: <=4 folder nesting, https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html.
4. Asked client to think about the design and content of their portfolio website.
5. Research alternatives to React: skimmed https://www.spec-india.com/blog/react-alternatives.
6. 2/3 of issue #1.
7. Created Vite app, after creating creating React app (and realising React comes with Webpack which is not necessary as Vite is an alternative to Webpack).

#### Thoughts:
1. TypeScript reduces bugs, but is it necessary for a simple website? It could be helpful, especially to make sure my props are of the right type. Also, it's something new to learn. I will use TypeScript.
2. I'll continue to use React because it works and there is some time-sensitivity to this project, so I don't want to use a completely new set of tools. How much time exactly? Definitely before November.
3. I will use Vite because it's easier to work with during development, enabling changes to be seen instantly. 
4. I will start from scratch without a boilerplate to deepen my understanding of the contents of the package.json file.
5. I will use Firebase for deployment because it's easy, free, and works. 
6. To plan the file structure, I need to know the site's contents.
7. Build Petr a blog to encourage his dream of writing. 

### 27/09/22
#### What I don't understand/know:
1. src folder
2. src > assets folder -- for images, etc?
3. Why is index.css imported in main.tsx (and not used)?
4. Is App.tsx the equivalent of App.jsx?
5. How does routing work? Where do you do your routing? In App.tsx?
6. How do I use Tailwind CSS here?

#### Actions / Achievements:
1. Research how a Vite-React-Typescript app works: https://developer.okta.com/blog/2022/03/14/react-vite-number-converter. React components are saved as .tsx files in the src/ folder. Routing in App.tsx.
2. Set up Tailwind CSS: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite, https://larainfo.com/blogs/install-setup-vite-react-typescript-tailwind-css-3.
3. Research how to add font: https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-use-custom-fonts-tailwind-css/#:~:text=Adding%20the%20local%20font%20to%20Tailwind&text=Using%20the%20font%2Dface%20rule,project%20via%20the%20src%20property.&text=And%20that's%20it!,installed%20font%20in%20the%20project.
